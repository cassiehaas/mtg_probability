# Standard Probabilities

Though there are many modes of playing Magic: The Gathering, Standard follows a few set rules. There is a minimum of 60 cards per deck, and at the start of each game, each player draws 7 cards. All cards are either lands, or require lands to play. Thus there is a required balance for each deck regarding the amount of lands necessary to cast. Too many, and there will be nothing to cast. You are left weak, and there is little game to be played. Too few lands, and you only get to gaze upon all of your options without being able to partake in any of them.

Thus, this calculator hopes to solve this issue. 'Solve' is a misnomer, though. This calculator hopes to simulate probability distributions of land amounts in your opening hand given the distribution of card types in your deck.
